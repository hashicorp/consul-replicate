## Consul Replicate CHANGELOG

## Unreleased

IMPROVEMENTS:

  - Update to go 1.20 [[GH-112]](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-replicate/pull/112)

## v0.4.0 (August 10, 2017)

IMPROVEMENTS:

  - Updated internal APIs and shared libraries

## v0.3.1.dev (January 28, 2017)

BUG FIXES:

  - Pass along the datacenter in parsed queries [GH-66]
  - Fix config file prefix parsing of the datacenter [GH-70]

## v0.3.0 (January 17, 2017)

BREAKING CHANGES:

  - It is no longer assumed that you want to mirror a "folder". If you want to
    mirror a folder (for example, all keys in `foo@dc1` to `foo@dc2`), you
    should specify dependencies using a trailing slash in the keys (`foo/@dc1`,
    `foo/@dc2`) moving forward. The new behavior allows replication for any key
    beginning with the prefix. For example, a configuration of
    `global@dc1:backup` would match anything in the `global/` folder, but it
    would also match a key named `globalization`, creating `backupization` in
    the target data center. [GH-54]

IMPROVEMENTS:

  - Add an `-exclude` option to exclude certain prefixes from replication. [GH-51]

BUG FIXES:

  - Fix -once mode never terminating. [GH-57]
  - Do not create keys with backslashes [GH-62]

## v0.2.0 (June 9, 2016)

IMPROVEMENTS:

  - Vendor dependencies to allow easier building from source
  - Fix race conditions [GH-39]

BUG FIXES:

  - Trim leading slashes on prefixes
  - Fix config merge ordering [GH-23]
  - Fix a number of config-related issues [GH-43]
  - Fix issues with keys vs. folder syncing [GH-25]

## v0.2.0 (February 26, 2015)

BREAKING CHANGES:

  - `-status` is no longer used and is not replaced - `-status-dir` is the
    closest replacement
  - Remove support for leader election - use `consul lock` instead (requires
    Consul 0.5+)

DEPRECATIONS:

  - `-src` is now part of the `-prefix` key
  - `-dst` is now part of the `-prefix` key
  - `-lock` is not used - run with `consul lock` instead
  - `-service` is not used - run with `consul lock` instead
  -  `-addr` is deprecated - use `-consul` instead

FEATURES:

  - Add support for specifying multiple prefixes via the `-prefix` option - the
    new `-prefix` option can be used to specify the source prefix and datacenter
    and optional destination prefix
  - Add support for using an HCL configuration file - this is especially helpful
    if you need to replicate multiple prefixes or have custom options that are
    cumbersome to specify via the CLI
  - Add support for specifying basic authentication
  - Add support for specifying the maximum staleness of a query
  - Add support for SSL
  - Add support for logging to syslog
  - Add support for specifying quiescence timers
  - Add support for specifying a retry interval
  - Add support for multiple log levels
  - Add support for running once and quitting
  - Use Consul Template's watching library for performance and durability

IMPROVEMENTS:

  - Improve test coverage, complete with integration tests

BUG FIXES:

  - Update README with examples and more documentation
  - Gracefully shut down when interrupted (prevents partial key replication)
