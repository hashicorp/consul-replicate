DataDog Agent Check for Consul-Replicate
===

This check helps in monitoring the health of consul-replicate.

To configure the check, write the master DC path into Consul KV
and set it as `master_dc_path` in the check configuration (the
.yaml file).

For each replicated KV store prefix or value that you wish to monitor,
add an entry under `check_paths` with the full KV path to a value that
changes frequently. The check will read that value from both local
and master DC Consul clusters and output a metric that tells whether
the value is readable and whether it is the same between the clusters.
